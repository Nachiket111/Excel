Superstore Analysis:

  This project analyzes sales data from a fictional SuperStore, aiming to uncover valuable insights that drive profitability and operational efficiency. Through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization, we identify trends in customer behavior, product performance, shipping modes, and regional dynamics. The final goal is to highlight underperforming segments or strategies and recommend data-driven actions for business improvement.

Perform EDA to understand sales, profits, discounts, customer demographics, and shipping patterns.
